<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more APK files from which the
  version codes should be read, in order to determine which APK versions should
  be re-assigned to a new release track.
  <p/>
  Note that these APKs should have already been uploaded â€” this build step will
  not do any uploading of APKs; it will only move existing APKs from one release
  track to another. To upload APKs, use the "Upload Android APK to Google Play"
  post-build action.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/outputs/*/*-release.apk</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only reference APKs that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  Applications which have several APKs per release, taking advantage of
  <a href='https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html'>
  Multiple APK Support</a>, should list all of the APK files here.<br/>
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
