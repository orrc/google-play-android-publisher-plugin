<div>
  The percentage of existing production users to which the given version code(s)
  should be rolled out.
  <p/>
  Google Play limits the percentage values to:
  <ul>
    <li>0.5%</li>
    <li>1%</li>
    <li>5%</li>
    <li>10%</li>
    <li>20%</li>
    <li>50%</li>
  </ul>
  If you enter no value here, or 100%, the app will be rolled out to all users.
  <p/>
  This field is ignored if you choose a release track other than 'production';
  releases to other tracks are always rolled out to 100% of the existing users.
  <p/>
  For more information on staged rollouts, see the Google Play documentation:<br/>
