  <p/>
  This can be one of:
  <ul>
    <li>alpha</li>
    <li>beta</li>
    <li>production</li>
  </ul>
  For production releases, you have the choice of rolling the version(s) out
  to all existing users simultaneously, or doing a staged rollout so that only
  a fraction of your existing userbase will be able to download the new version.

  For more information on alpha and beta testing, or staged rollouts, see the
  Google Play documentation:<br/>
