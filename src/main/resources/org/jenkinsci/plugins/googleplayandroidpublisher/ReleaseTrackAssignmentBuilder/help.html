  If you have already uploaded APKs to Google Play, whether manually, via the
  "Upload Android APK to Google Play" post-build action, or by other means, this
  build step allows you to change the release track for specific APKs.
  <p/>
  For example, you can use this to promote an app currently in alpha testing to
  the beta release track, once you've decided it's ready for a wider audience.
  <p/>
  Similarly, once you're ready for release, you can move from beta to a staged
  rollout, or directly to production.
  <p/>
  Note that "downgrading" release tracks, e.g. from production to alpha is not
  possible.
