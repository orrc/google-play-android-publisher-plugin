<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching zero or more
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html">
  expansion files</a> that should be associated with the APK files being
  uploaded to Google Play.
  <p/>
  You can list as many or as few expansion files as you like &mdash; you have
  the option of associating previously-uploaded expansion files with the new
  APKs being uploading here.

  <h2>Naming</h2>
  Files <b>must</b> be named in the format
  <tt>[main|patch].&lt;expansion-version&gt;.&lt;application-id&gt.obb</tt>
  <p/>
  For example:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>main.1000.com.example.mygame.obb</tt></li>
    <li><tt>patch.1002.com.example.mygame.obb</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Patterns</h2>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/*.obb</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only upload OBB files that are located in your workspace.

  <h2>Re-using existing expansion files</h2>
  If you don't provide a main or patch expansion file for every APK that you
  want to upload, enabling the "Re-use expansion files from existing APKs where
  necessary" option will automatically associate existing expansion file(s) with
  the APK(s) being uploaded.
  <p/>
  With this option enabled, if not enough expansion files are provided for all
  of the APK(s) being uploaded, this plugin will search for the <i>newest</i>,
  previously-uploaded APKs on Google Play with main or patch expansion files,
  and will associate those files with the new APK(s) being uploaded here.
  <p/>
  For example: If you want to upload a new APK, but the expansion files have not
  changed at all, you should leave the "Expansion files" field blank, but enable
  the checkbox.<br/>
  At build time, the latest existing main (and patch, if available) expansion
  files will be associated with the newly-uploaded APK.
  <p/>
  Similarly, if you have a new build, but only want to change the patch file,
  then just provide the patch expansion file and make sure this option is
  checked. The uploaded APK will have the existing main expansion file
  associated with it, along with the newly-uploaded patch file.

  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
